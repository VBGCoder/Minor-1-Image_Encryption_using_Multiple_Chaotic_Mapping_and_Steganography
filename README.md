<h1>Image Encryption using Multiple Chaotic Mapping and Steganography</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The project is aimed at delivering an image-encryption solution while incorporating abstraction of image data using steganography.​​
Since traditional encryption algorithms like AES and RSA  does not work well in cases where multi-dimensional data is used, different mathematical concepts and theories have been used in algorithms that are specific to image. This approach makes it easy and reliable to encrypt an image with single or multiple colour channels. ​​
Using two images, target image and a base image of same size, manipulation of pixels results in an ambiguous image.​</p>

<h1>Image Encryption using Multiple Chaotic Mapping and Steganography with Published Research Paper</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The project is aimed at delivering an image-encryption solution while incorporating abstraction of image data using steganography.​​
&nbsp;Since traditional encryption algorithms like AES and RSA  does not work well in cases where multi-dimensional data is used, different mathematical concepts and theories have been used in algorithms that are specific to image. This approach makes it easy and reliable to encrypt an image with single or multiple colour channels. ​​
Using two images, target image and a base image of same size, manipulation of pixels results in an ambiguous image.​</p>

<h2>Technical Concepts used​</h2><p>
  
  ​
**Chaos Theory:-**
Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary scientific theory and branch of physics.​ It focuses on underlying patterns and deterministic laws of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions and were once thought to have completely random states of disorder and irregularities.​

**Henon Map:​-**
​Henon Map is one of the discrete chaotic maps that define some chaotic behaviour.​ A starting point is used in two equations to generate the next point. This is done repeatedly, and the resultant resembles simple chaos. ​It is formed by using a point (xn, yn) to map the next point using the following equation, where xn and yn are the current point positions, while xn+1 and yn+1 are the next point positions.​

**​Image steganography:​-**
​Image steganography is simple bit manipulation used to remove unnecessary or less-important data. ​Each pixel value can be represented as an 8-bit binary number where the left-most bits are most significant and right-most bits least significant. ​The most significant 4-bits of each pixel value of the target image are hidden in the 4 least significant bits of the base image. ​

**Arnold Cat Map:​-**
​Arnold Cat Map is a chaotic map defined for square matrices used to randomize the pixel positions in an image. ​By using its two equations, new transformed values of each pixel is substituted in the image, which can only be recovered using same parameters in the inverse transformations.​ ACM works by scrambling a pixel’s position without changing the value of the pixel itself. This can be done using the following formula ​
